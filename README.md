The building of numberous cover letters can be daunting.   Yet, every employer does not want to see a generic cover letter.  Like a customer it is important that thier name, and the words specifically used by the employer are used.   There are some common name and words that vary slightly between employers for the same role.  Often the Cover letters an applicant is writing is exactly the same but with some additions, modifications, and subtractions specific to the employer.   This is normally a manual task.   This task takes too long, it can and should be automated.
